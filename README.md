**Single Cell RNA Sequence Data Analysis On Cancerous Tumours (Ongoing)**

Created an R pipeline using FastQC, Bioconductor and Seurat to preprocess and clean single cell RNA sequence datasets, perform
Principal Component Analysis and identify anomalous differential gene expression due to excess cell division in cancerous tumours from various tissues.
